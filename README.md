# Morning Bru! â˜•

During my continous learning about [React](https://reactjs.org/), I dedicated some time to familiarise myself with calls to APIs with the [Redux-Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) middleware. Redux with React itself presented quite a learning curve and I heard that Redux-Saga presents the same. So I started off by practicing with calls to APIs: to [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and to [The Internet Chuck Norris Database](https://api.icndb.com/) (Chuck Norris jokes are <em>still</em> a joke apparently). Moreover, I also made use of Reacts new hooks: [useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) and [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) to get information on COVID-19 case numbers from [Postman APIs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc?version=latest). I'm sure a lot of the cases are incorrect but South Africa's case number is correct. So with all of this, I've created a perfect website for the trimmed-bearded-individual based in Cape Town's city centre who'll enjoy some news headlines, Chuck Norris jokes and scoff over the case numbers while sipping his morning brew. Enjoy!
